  "readme": "# Rebuild\n\nRebuild is a simple utility that does just one thing: it watches one or more files or directories for changes and runs a command when they change. That's it. It's intended to be used with command line build systems, but you can't really use it for anything.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install rebuild -g\n\n## Usage\n\nSpecify any number of files or directories using `-w` or `--watch`. Then just include whatever command you want to run. For example, if you just want to run `ls` whenever files in the `tmp` directory change, you would do this:\n\n    rebuild -w tmp ls\n\nThe directory is resolved based on the current working directory for both the files and directories to watch and the command to run. Other examples:\n\n    # Run \"ant test\" when the files in src change\n    rebuild -w src ant test\n    \n    # Automatically check in files in src and docs when they change\n    rebuild -w src -w docs git commit -am \"Just wanted to check these in\"\n    ",
